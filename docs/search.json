I then got more of a passion for coding languages like Python and R later into my undergrad and discovered the true power of pairing computer science with statisitics. I also enjoy the data cleaning process unfortunately and also like to work with big data since I think there is more potential with bigger sets of data.\nPart 2\nWe calculate the density estimation of the Sepal Length variable here from the iris dataset and store it in the object ‘y’.\ny &lt;- density(iris$Sepal.Length)\nWe determine the class, type and strutcture of the object ‘y’ using the ‘class’, ‘typeof’, and ‘str’ functions\nclass(y)\ntypeof(y)\nstr(y)\nWe use the plot function here to visualize the density estimation of the Sepal Length variable that is stored in ‘y’. We also set echo to false to hide the R code in the final document.\nplot(y, main = “Density Plot of Sepal Length”, xlab = “Sepal Length”, ylab = “Density”)"
